## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- The `customer_data.xlsx` and `loan_data.xlsx` files.

### How to Run
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repo-link>
    cd <your-repo-name>
    ```
2.  **Place Data Files:**
    Place the `customer_data.xlsx` and `loan_data.xlsx` files in the root of the project directory.

3.  **Run the application:**
    Use the single docker-compose command. This will build the images and start all services.
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4.  **Set up the database (in a second terminal):**
    Once the containers are running, open a new terminal and run the following commands to set up the database and ingest the data.
    ```sh
    # Apply database migrations
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

    # Ingest data from Excel files
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py ingest_data
    ```
The application is now running at `http://localhost:8000`.
